🌞 EcoVision Solar Placement App
EcoVision is an AI-powered web app that helps users identify the best locations on their rooftops to install solar panels. It uses computer vision and solar algorithms to recommend optimal panel placement, orientation, and tilt.

🚀 Features
📤 Upload rooftop image or 📸 capture using camera 

🧠 AI object detection (YOLO) to identify obstructions (poles, tanks, trees)

🌞 Computes sun position (azimuth + altitude) using PySolar

📐 Suggests:

Shadow-free areas for panel placement

Optimal tilt angle

Recommended orientation based on sun’s position

⚡ Govt solar subsidy info with interactive dropdown (all Indian states + UTs)

🤖 AI recommendations for creative solar utilization (via Gemini API)

🛠 Tech Stack
Backend: Flask + Python
